# PicoCTF2022 : basic_file_exploit challenge writeup

Let's start by downloading the file from the link. We get the source code of the program with the flag redacted. The goal is to understand the program's logic and exploit it to get the flag

## The quick approach

One way we can go about this is to search directly for the line of the file in which the flag array is used. We end up in the `data_read()` function.
